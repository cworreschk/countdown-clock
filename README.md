# Countdown-Clock
The church [Die Basis](http://www.die-basis.org) in Mainz, Germany wanted a simple HTML page with a configurable countdown and clock for their session. So I have started this project to realize their wish.

## Demo
[die-basis.org/clock_v2](http://www.die-basis.org/clock_v2/index.html)

## Third party plugins
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/)
- [jQuery miniColors](http://www.abeautifulsite.net/blog/2011/02/jquery-minicolors-a-color-selector-for-input-controls)

## Usage
Simply upload the code to your server and run the _index.html_ :)
To change the settings or to start the countdown/clock just go with your mouse pointer to the left side of the page.
