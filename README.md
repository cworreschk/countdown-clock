# Countdown-Clock
The church [Die Basis](http://www.die-basis.org) in Mainz, Germany wanted a simple HTML page with a configurable countdown and clock for their session. So I have started this project to realize their wish.

## Third party plugins
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/)
- [jQuery miniColors](http://www.abeautifulsite.net/blog/2011/02/jquery-minicolors-a-color-selector-for-input-controls)

## Usage
Simply upload the code to your server and run the _index.html_ :)
To change the settings or to start the countdown/clock just go with your mouse pointer to the left side of the page.

## Contributing
Uikit::Sass:Rails follows the [GitFlow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model). The ```master``` branch always reflects a production-ready state while the latest development is taking place in the ```develop``` branch.

Each time you want to work on a fix or a new feature, create a new branch based on the ```develop``` branch: ```git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME develop```. Only pull requests to the ```develop``` branch will be merged.
